I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science & Engineering at the Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology. I have worked as a Full Stack Web Developer In Dotlines and as a Jr. Machine Learning Engineer (R&D), at Adon Venture, where I specialized in multilingual text processing. As a Research Assistant at the Pioneer Alpha Lab, I lead a project on medical image.

I possess a deep understanding of statistical concepts, deep learning, and large language models, along with extensive experience in programming languages and frameworks, particularly Python and C. My background also includes Full Stack Web Development, making me well-suited for R&D roles where both prototype development and pioneering research are critical
