## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I completed my **B.Sc. in Computer Science & Engineering** at Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology.

### I have worked as a:
- **Jr. Machine Learning Engineer (R&D)** at Adon Venture, specializing in multilingual text processing

Additionally, as a **Research Assistant** at the Pioneer Alpha Lab, I led a project focused on medical imaging.

### I possess a deep understanding of:
- Statistical concepts
- Deep learning
- Large language models

With extensive experience in programming languages, particularly **Python and C**, I am also skilled in Full Stack Web Development, making me well-suited for R&D roles that require both prototype development and pioneering research. I absolutely love contributing to R&D projects!

**ðŸ”­ Currently seeking PhD admission roles across the USA.**
